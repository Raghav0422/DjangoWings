Django course,

creating virtual environment before Django installation
		py -m venv myworld
	it will create virtual environment my world with files: include, lib, script, pyvnv.cng
	
Then you have to activate the environment, by typing this command:
		myworld\Scripts\activate.bat (mworld is name of the environment)

Now install django
		py -m pip install Django
		
INstall RestFramework
	pip install djangorestframework
		in my case below not work
	py -m pip install djangorestframework
		

CREATING Project
*How to create project with CMD command in VS code
		django-admin startproject smartnotes(
	it is our folder/project name) .(dot indicates new project will be created in this location)
	i have tried above but not work, in my case command work is 
		python -m django startproject smartnotes
		or 
		py -m django startproject smartnotes
		
	thiscommand creates two thing manage.py file and the smartnotes
	*manage.py file is the enterance of the project
	
	go to the location of the file, and type 
				python manage.py runserver
	hit enter you will see the project runing django starting page
	to run on different server enter port number at end
				python manage.py runserver 77777

*Next step is to create a django application inside django project
	use command
				python manage.py startapp firstApp (here firstApp is App name)
			this command will create firstApp folder inside the django project name is smartnotes
	
*Next steps is we need to add this application under INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py file inside project folder which is smartnotes

Now time to create VIEWS, VIEWS creation in views.py

	view is responsible for taking request and returning the response back
	
	There are two type of views:
		Class based
		Function based
	
	FUNCTION BASED VIEWS:
		first we will import HttpResponse via below code:
					from django.http import HttpResponse
		below is the first function code:
			def display(request):   #what request doing here? Browser will request something when click on some button or typing in webpage it will be stored in the request object
				return HttpResponse("<h1>This is my first Django App!!!</h1>") # now views need to return something he will return HttpResponse
				
*Next step now view is created we will add the path in the urls.py inside the project
		first we will import the views from the firstApp folder via
					from firstApp import views
		and after then we set a path(,) here first parameter contain the URL name and other views function like
					path("hello/",views.display)
			
* Now we will create templates
	what is templates? it is simple UI for the web browser, or inshort HTML code
	first we make the templates folder in the Project smartnotes
	and inside that folder we will create a subFolders or templease, like templateApp
	
* after creating templates folder its time to add in project settings.py
	got to Template Directory check for base DIRS
	and enter the below 
			"DIRS":[os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],
	
*Next is to create a .html file in tempaltesApp folder
			firstTemplate.html
		just create a html file code script which you want to show in your web browser
		
*now got to the views.py of this project, to create a view
	same as above but there is slight change in the template we dont required the HttpResponse to import as no use
	render is already imported so we will use this
			from django.shortcuts import render
	now we will create a function(request) and return same what render is returning
			def myFun(request):
				return render(request, 'templateApp/firstTemplate.html')
		this render is same as the imported render
		two arguments, with first tell render as per the request come, and second what template to show
		
*now its time to configure the URL in urls.py for our new views for template
	same process
	
*Lets learn something about templates in Django
	As we know templates are the web apllication UI, it contains HTML code
	now here we can use dynamic data which might come from the Views request how via double flower bracies
			{{data}}
	there is also DTL Django Templates Library, where we can use some tokens to work like JS or programming inside django html codes
		Example:
					{%csrf_token}
					there is extends token to extends other template
						{% x extends y %}
					if condition:
						{%If condtition%}
					ends with 
						{%endif%}
					same for condition and end for
	these all are come from the inbuild engine , you can check in settings Templates  BACKEND here is the written from where it come
	
*Now tranferring the data from the views to templates
	It can be done  using render() function. as shown earlier
		render(requst,tempelate, data)
	and template will show the data in currley braces or flower braces {{data}}
	* one thing to rememmber data will pass in dictionary format\
		below file in views.py
				from django.shortcuts import render
					def renderTemplate(request):
						myDict={"name":"Raghav"}
						return render(request, 'templateApp/firstTemplate.html', context=myDict)
			here the context is just name parameter no need to enter you can simply pass the dictionary variable directly					
		
		below code in firstTemplate in HTML, 
			we will simply write {{name}} and it will work in hrml file, nothing hard to do
	
	*ALWAYS REMEMMBER IF YOU HAVE CREATED NEW TEMPLATE IT MUST NEED TO BE ADD IN URLS.PY
*CREATING STATIC files images css etc
	so first we create a static folder inside our project
		then inside a a image folder, and here all image files
	*now need to made changes in settings.py inside project
		here we will look for static and will add the static directory 
		 so we will pick the DIRS from starting as same as templates we did above
					STATIC_URL = "static/"
					STATICFILE_DIRS=[Path.joinpath(BASE_DIR,'static')], #here static is stacic folder name inside templateDemo
							# for OS
							#STATICFILE_DIRS=[os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')],
							
		you can check if the file is loaded or not,. smiply we wnt to oue web page and after local host we will type
				static/image/imagename.jpeg
			as it is directly loading from the image and we have set the Static path in settings.py so no need to set i externaly on url.py
				
	after done with settings change, now time to add in the templates
	we will open our template.html file whatever we have created or where we want to import it
	we will use the template token which is
			{%load static%}  #{%load staticfiles%} this is our old dajngo versions
		and simply in html code we will add it, above code will load the files fropm the location like programing import
			<img src="{%static "image/imagename.jpeg"%}"/>
		thats all, 
		
	adding CSS folder 
		simply create css folder inside static folder and then emp.css file
		now link it in template folder same as we did for image and using css <link rel vali line
					<link rel="stylesheet" href="{%static "css/emp.css"%}"
		thats all
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRACTICE TIME
	we will create a new project ,things you must done from above
	1:creating a project:
		django-admin startproject Products
		or
		py -m django startproject smartnotes
	2: creating application
		python manage.py startapp Product
	3: add this app stetings.py
		go in INSTALLED_APPS and add the Product which is our application
	4: create templates and static folder in project level
			
	5: add the template in settings.py
		adding these folder is settings.py
			how? simply check the base_directory path and add it
			BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
			TEMPLATES_DIR=os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')
			STATIC_DIR=os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')
		this seems to be slightly different as we have created variables in the settings.py and now adding these variables in
		TEMPLATE and STATIC 
			for TEMPLATE we will use
				"DIR":[TEMPLATES_DIR]
			
			for STATIC we use
				STATICFILES_DIRS=[STATIC_DIR]
	
	6: Now we will create folder productApp inside  template folder and inside it index.html
		here we will declare three card, electropnic shoes and toys as list ul
			dont forget to load static via code in begining
				{%load staticfiles%}
			NOt worked so i used below
				{%load static%}
				
		Point to remember when loading css or image inside the html file we will use href or src in {%%} this braces
		like:
			<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href="{% static 'css/product.css'%}">
		here static is the folder, css is another folder inside static and product.css is file	
		
	
	7: now create new file inside template product app folder called it products.html
		this file will be our dynamic file, for all the three templates, electronics, toys and shop
		now here we will fetch data from views via {{}} thos double curley braces
			and dont forget to load static file
	
	8:now its time to create views in views.py inside app which is product.app
		separate function for each electronic toys and shoes
		and return render with three parametrs one is returning request, template name and context (context will be dictionary variable name)
		and we will add here a default views, which will return when we ahve default 8000
						def index(request):
							return render(request,'productsApp/products.html')
	
	9:now add the views in urls.py of the project which is product		

---------------------------------------
MODEL CREATION AND LEARNING TIME
	you know that already, what is model its just the data variable deceleration page, where we declare the variable 
	variable= charfield type 
	every model is new database in the project, 
	and every class in the model is field in database
		
	Steps creating model:
		create project:
		configure database
		create model class
		Register it in Admin
		make migration > Migrate
		Use the model in view
			
	Now lets create new project and app project name will be Model and app name will be Modelapp
		this time do in yourself and dont forget to register app in setting .py
	Now its time for database setup in settings.py as model is all about data
		so in datbase inside settings.py, already database is declared, so all we need to use it (here talking about sqlite DB)
		if you can you can declare your own for oracle, password etc will be required
		
	-----DATABASE CONNECTION TESTING------------------	
		so just to check if database connection is established or not we will check in python shell
			python manage.py shell
				from django.db import connection
				c=connection.cursor()
			if above code executed without error that means you will be able to use database connectivity of sql lite
			
	Now My Sql connection with database
		simple in the place of sqlite3 we will use mysql for Engine variable
		and NAME: emplyeedb (it is database name) before that it was the database path name for mysqlite 
		USER: root
		PASSWORD: jo b aapka 
		
	All configuration done now its time for Model creation
		import models from django.db
		simple thing just create the class anyname and then extends with models.MODEL
		once done now its class body time here we will declare variable and there type from models object
			example:
				firstname= models.CharField(max_length=30)
	
	Now model is created its time to convert it to DB table
		simple table content already set in model,
		so we will run command
				python manage.py makemigrations
			it will create model query with same name as your class name in model.py here i am using Employee
			from this command we means simply create query for the table we will gona create in database
			and this command will create a file inside migration like 001
			
		so if you want to check which sql command/query will run you can check via below command
				python manage.py sqlmigrate ModelApp(its my application name in django) 001 (its migration field name)
			this command will give you the SQL query which we gona perform
			
		and then we will run another command, this command is for running the query which is created via makemigrations
				python manage.py migrate
			this command tells that push the table or create table in the database (different things)
			
	Now we will add the model in views, or we will create views for model
		first import the Employee (this is Model function name which we have craeted in the model.py)
				from ModelApp.models import Employee
		then create function with request as arguments
		declare a variable which hold all object data	
				employee=Employee.object.all()
		and then creat a dictionary which hold employees data
				empDict={'employees': employee}
		and now return 
				return render(request,"ModelApp/employees.html",empDict)
								OR
				return render(request,"employees.html",empDict)
		
	Now time to create template inside ModelApp
		first thing declaring template path directory
		for that command is:
				TEMPLATE_DIRS=os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'template') (yanha jo template name hai na must be equal to folder name 
																		template tu smj gyaa)
		and template folder inside project and inside that create html file
				
	Now file creation is done, templates created and now add that templates in views (for this project already done)
	
	and then URL.py add the views and the link in urls.py path
	
	now add the information table, via SQL or My SQL to fetch data
	
	WORKING:
		model.py just for model structure, here variable declartion is main as we will use this, and class name is your table name 
		in views we will fetch the objectes in model.py via function
				employee=Employee.object.all() (here Employee is class name in model.py)
			after then we will create a dictionary with key and value, for employee var which we declare above
		and then return the render	
				return(request,templatefile path,dictionary variable)
		now setup the template.html with your code and design
			here {{}} is used for variable or value printing and {%%} is used for python tags like if loop etc.
			if endif, for end for, with endwith
		One thing to remember, we are fetching data from the Sql database, 
		so the cursor must be on point 1 , Raghav you did in java to run loop so that pointer or cursor can com on 1st row
		and fetch data, and same need to do here, so the for loop is mandatory
			{%for emp in emplyees%} (here employees is key of dictionary which we declared in views)
				{{emp.id}}
			{%endfor%}
		above syntax will be enough		
		
	def __str___():
		In model class some time we define this thing , actually override it, so reason is to show the name in site appear in DRF restframe work, 
		we will return any variable we have just created in the Model class
				return self.employee
				
NOTE: whenever you create a model class and want to see it in admin panel you first have to register it in admin.py and onl then it will appear in Admin DRF website ok
		
----------------------------------------------
SUPER USER TO RUN ADMIN
	CREATING SUPER USER TO RUN ADMIN? IN URL
		so to login in default admin page we need to create super user and it can be done via
				python manage.py createsuperuser
			it will ask for name password email etc, you can skip email
		after then you will able to login in admin, and then you can manage the group and the users 

	REGISTERING site in admin 
		admin is good tool to manage the data of model direltly with interface rather then going to sql or mysql
		it has CRUD property
			so open admin.py and register the model via below
					admin.site.register(class name of Model) (before using class in model import that class as well)			
		
		normal look feel can be change for admin vali creating class admin.ModelAdmin apnaa parent and just create list
		and list name must be
				list_display=[list of name of all]
				
------------------------
Application based URLS
	simply we will create urls.py in application level,
	or you can copy the existing one from project level, everything will remain same just delete the admin vala
	
	now its time to include the app level url in project level urls
	so we will simply import include module as well with path module
	and the body will be like:
			path('firstapp/',include('firstapp.urls'))
				
-------------------------
JSON usage,
	all things will be same, creating project , then app, listing app in settings, making templates, listing templates
	directory in settings, creating views
		difference is here will will import JsonResponse rather then HttpResponse
			from django.http import Jsonresponse
		reset is same will define a function with request paramneter, 
			below will be the Json code in emp={} inside this 
		and will return the variable as response
			return JsonResponse(emp)
	and last calling the url in url.py
	
-------------------------------------------
SERIALIZERS 
	Defination: 
		It is use to convert Object Data or database to the JSON or Client required format\
		inshort databse to chuk k JSON bnana
	It provide two types of classes 
		Serializers and ModelSerializers (we will use ModelSerializer)
		
	SERIALIZER: First we will learn About Serialzers:
		in serializers we will take all the variables defined in the Model , 
		and do same as the we defined in Model but via serializers
			Example:
						id=serializers.IntergerField(read_only=True)
						name=serializers.CharField()
		
		To handle the code for PUT view we need to define a function inside our class is create
						def create(self, validated_data): (validated_data carries the new values)
							return Movie.objects.create(**validated_data)
		For Update will do same thing 
						def update(self,instance ,validated_data): (instance carries old values and validated_data carries new values)
				once function is created new need to pass the New data from validated_data to old instance data
						instane.name=validated_data.name('name', instance.name) (here name is the variable name and instance.name is just to define Old name)
						
		
		Now Go to Views:
			Create class, with parent class APIViews or create dunction with request in parenthesis
				define the variable model and pass the Model object
						movie=Movie.object.all() (Movie is the Model class name which we have defined or going to deine)
				
				now define the variable serializer and make the conversion of model to serializer and pass to the variable
						serializer= MovieSerializer(movie, many=True) (MovieSerializer is the Serializer class name of serializer and movie is the defined variable), (many=True is defined when we need to get teh multiple Object form server)
						
				Thats all now return the response all serializer data
						return Response(serializer.data)
		
		For FUNCTION BASED VIEWS we will import the @api_view decorator 
					@api_view() or @api_view('GET') or @api_view('GET','POST')
					
						
		
	Working:
	we will create serializer.py file in our application
		first we wil import serialzers.py from rest_framework
		so where this rest_framework comes we need to import it from github via
			git clone https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework
		better to use below pip command to instal djangorestframework
			py -m pip install djangorestframework
			
						if in case not able to load just download the folder from github and unzip in location  python site-package location,
						and put rest_framework out from the folder (might required other folder out as well)
						might not work above thing better to install it or get it installed via
							py -m pip install djangorestframework
						
						and then import it via below line 
							from django_rest_framework.rest_framework import serializers (not required used before when is was wrong check 
																				class Based Views below for perfect things)
		
		once all done dont forget to add rest_framework in settings Installed_APPS
		
		MODEL SERIALIZER:
		
			Creating Model for serializer
			We will create model,in models.py  Simply with details , id ,email, name etc
				 create a class and make parent class models.Model
					and then rest details
		
		Now back to serializer.py
			and import above model class in serializer.py which we have created
				from firstapp.models import Info(Model class name)
			
			Create class make its parent ModelSerializer via using serializer.Modelserialzer in parenthesis
					we will create serialzer with same data which might created duplicacy
					this is the reason we sometime use ModelSerializer rather then Serializer 
					just to extends the Model class it helps developers better
				inside it create Meta class (every variable name must be same as it is as it is predefined)
					class Meta:
						(define a variable model and pass the Model class which we have crated in it)
							model= Info (its model class)
							fields=[fields name] (all the variable inside Model.py in single commas, 
													its array declares to restrict the model fields, data enter here only be
													serialized when we run or save, you can define all or few )
													
							(You can also use "__all__" and it includes all the fields in model
							and if you have multiple fields you can use 
										exclude=[name of fields]
							it will exclude the fields defined and take rest other fields		
								
		
		Now Views creation time:
			and import  model class in views.py which we have created
				from firstapp.models import Info(Model class name)
				
			and also import Serialzer class which we have created serializer.py
				from firstapp.serializer import InfoSerializer
			
			and also import Response from rest_framework.response
				from rest_framework.response import Response
				
			and also import status from rest_framework
			
			and also import api_view from rest_framework.decorator (will use this app_view to tell the method we are going to	
																		use in serializer function)
			
			use this @api_view([methods list after commas]) before defining function so that django can understand which method
			you gona use in this function
				@api_view(['GET','POST'])
				
			now create a function with parameter request
			
			now we will add If condition like, if requested method is GET, POST or something else
			before doing that just for reminder if method is GET it means data need to be fetch from Model
			so we simply Fetch data from model, convert it into serialzer how with class constructor in serialyer
			with twoo paramters one for the model data which we have get, and other many=True
			and then return it with Response and serialzer.data as parameter value
			
			If the method is POST first we will take the data from URL, as you know post means uploading data in database
			so taking data drom URL first and then pass to serializer (it will be done in single line of code)
			then we will check data we recived from URL is valid or not 
			if yes then save it and return status created
			if false then return status bad_request
			
				If request.method =='GET':
					info= Info.objects.all() (getting all object from model class) once you get the all data pass to serialzer
					serializer= InfoSerializer(info,many=true) here parameter info is is the above variable
					return Response(serializer.data) last thing returning the serialized data via Responseof rest_framework
					
				elif request.method=='POST':
					postSerializer= InfoSerializer(data=request.data) (just getting details from URL and trf to data var)
					if postSerializer.is_valid():
						postSerializer.save()
						return Response(postSerializer.data,status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
					return Response(postSerializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
					
			PRIMARY KEY URL CREATNG function to enter the details or handle details update get as per pk primary key
			do add the above decorator as per GET PUT DELETE as we are going to use them in the views function
				create a function with parameter request,pk
					
					def infoDetailsViews(request,pk)
					
				in the body we will enter the code to get the details from the primary key recieved from URL
				to check if this pk data exists or not in database, all will be done in try except block
				normally we take all objects from model, this time only data retrive from model with pk> thenc do exception for 
				user not exist> then return Response not found
					
					try:
						data=InfoModel.object.get(pk=pk)
					except InfoModel.DoesNotExist:
						return Response(status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)
				
				now we will create three conditions if GET POST or DELETE
					GET same as above (no need for variable it is defined in try catch user it)
					PUT body 	
						elif request.metod=='PUT':
							movie= Movie.Objects.get(pk=pk) (just to define which object we are going to update else it will create the new object rather than updating the current exisying object)
							idwPUTserializer=InfoSerializer(dataFromIDW,data=request.data)
							if idwPUTserializer.is_valid():
								idwPUTserializer.save()
								return Response(idwPUTserializer.data)
							return Response(idwPUTserializer.errors,status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
					DELETE body
						elif request.method=='DELETE':
							movie= Movie.Objects.get(pk=pk)
							dataFromIDW.delete()
							return Response(status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)		
 
		Now time to adding views in URL, we will add fucntion lets go to app URLS.py
			as we have created two views function, so will two path for URL
			one will be done normally
			for other who have GET PUT DELETE for PK main is PK primary key we have to put the PK in URL
				path('infoList/<int:pk>',views.infoSeriDetailsViews)
		
		Thats all, Now need to TEST our Views and get, Post put  , it can be simply be  done by the site
		just open the site which we have created you will see a perfect framework created by RestFramework, and just 
		make the changes test and check all your POST, PUT DElete GET are working fine or not
		
		In that screen you will see the data coming from Sqlite database with the rest framework.
		you cand use DLETE get option via primary key
	
	CUSTOM SERIALIZER FIELDS:
		incase you want to create the field to be appeared in data just for test purpose so rather then creating the new field in the Model and defining all the details you can simply create the field in the Serializer , it will help you to avoid the lot of work
		
		HOW to DO IT:
			simply in the serializer class(above the META class) define the variable name with serializers.SerializerMethodField()
					len_name= serializers.SerializerMethodField()
					
			once decleration is done to get it workf we need to create a function as the SerializerMethodFieldwill call some function
			and by default it wil call get_nameOfField (whatever we have given in this case its len_name) so function name will be
					def get_len_name(self,object): (object store all the fields name)
						return len(object.name)
---------------------------------		
VALIDATION:
	Three type of validation: Field Level, Object Level, Validator
	We will add this validation in Serializer.py inside its class there will be function,
	
	Field-Level Validators: so we are adding validation on a single field like Name, or description, or any defined variable serializer class
		and that Function is defined use same, validate_name(self,value) (here the word name will teh field name which need to be changed and the value to get the value which you will get)
					def validate_name(self,value):
						if len(value)<2:
							raise serializer.ValidationError("Name is too short")
						else:
							return value
							
	OBJECT LEVEL VALIDATION: 
		we will use def validate (self, data) (by validate we means we are going to apply validation on Object, )
					
					def validate(self, data):
						if data['name']==data['description']: (here name and the description are the variable name declared in serializer)
							raise serializer.ValidationError("Cannot be same")
						return data
						
	VALIDATORS:
		validator is argument which need to be passed to our Current page, 
		first we need to defile the validator class in the field while decearing the variable in serializer
				Eg. name=serializer.CharField(validators=[name_length])  (here the name_length will be the function which we are going to define to perform some logic)
				
				def name_length(value):
					if len(value)<2:
						raise ValidationError("name is too short")
						
			This function will be defined out of the class scope
			
	
FOR Model Serializer you have to define all inside the Class, first create the class and then Meta class and with same scope of Meta class do define all the validation 

MaxValueValidator and MinValueValidator
	from dajngo.core.validator import MaxValueValidator, MinValueValidator
	
	order=models.PositivieIntergerField(validators=[MaxValueValidator(100), MinValueValidator(1)]
					
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SERIALIZER VARIABLE:
	here we will define how to create the variable and why
		simple in the serialzer class define the variable in same way we do in model
	
			password2= serializer.CharField(style={'input_type':'password'},write_only=True)
		
		the above code snipt is doing creating additional field rather than the fields defined in model
		and its password field just to guide you how Password field should be
		must be write only access and style must be password * vala
		
NOW IF YOU NEED TO MAKE THE SOME VARIABLE CHANGES IN THE SERIALIZER WHICH IS CREATED IN MODELS
	simply define it in extra_kwargs={}
	so as wel now in serializer there is class meta with default field, model and fields and now we will add one other field
			extra_kwargs={
				'password':{'write_only':True}
			}
	here password is the field defined in the models and we just add the extra style which we have not added on time of model creation
---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS BASED VIEWS
	Create Project do above things,
	create App
		install djangorestframework
		add both rest_framework and application name in the settings.py INSTALLED_APPS
		setting the directort or BASE_DIR in settings.py (check above things)
		for templates as well
	create model 
	create serializer
	creat urls
	
	Actually I MASTERD this thing without Documntation so simply gonna write what i know, 
	
	ok so its is same as function based views difference in class based views we user APIViews as parameter
			class firstView(APIViews):
				def get(self, request):
					#body
					return Response('bla bla bla')
		
		so it is same as function based thing is here we dont use the deciorators we will only use the function
		and the functions are defined so we will overide it
		def get(self,request), def post(self,request), def put(self,request, pk), def delete(self,request, pk)	
		
	in function based we are using If request.method=='GET' etc etc
	here will use the function overided
	and thats all,
	other difference is we use APIview not decorators lik @api_views
	and in URL py for the class based
	
		we will import the Class from views one by one
		and will make path as , as_views()
			path['endpoint/',className.as_view()]
		only then it will work, where in function based views we only enter the view function name
------------------------------------------------
GENREIC VIEWS GenericAPIView:
	generic views just short down the work done in APIViews its APIViews replacemnet with mixins and generic
	we don need to write each view things , we will user queryset and serializer_class,
	mixins need to be imported from 
	generic need to be import: from rest_framework import generics , mixins
	EXAMPLE:
			class Employee(mixins.ListModelMixin, mixins.CreateModelMixin, generics.GenericAPIView): 
				queryset= SubjectModel.object.all() (model need to be passed to queryset)
				serializer_class=SybjectSerializer  (pass the serilaizer class t serializer_class)
				
				def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
					return self.list(request,*args, **kwargs)
					
				def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
					return self.create(request,*args, **kwargs)
					
	To get the single Model to be fethed we will use the retrieve method of mixins
			class Employee(mixins.RetrieveModleMixin, generics.GenericAPIView): 
				queryset= SubjectModel.object.all() (model need to be passed to queryset)
				serializer_class=SybjectSerializer  (pass the serilaizer class t serializer_class)
				
				def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
					return self.retrieve(request,*args, **kwargs)
--------------------------------------------
CONCRETE VIEW CLASSES:
	first we use APIViews class and define get pots etc methods to get it work, 
	to reduce it we shifted to GenericAPIView where we only define the queryset and serializer_class with get post function
	and now moving to vconcerete class where  we only define the queryset and serializer_class
	
	in the backend it is performing all the things but we ponly need to do that simple, not so lengthy codejust 
	make parent class,
	
					class Employee(generic.ListCreateAPIView):
						queryset= SubjectModel.object.all() 
						serializer_class=SybjectSerializer  
						
	Thats all done
	ListCreateAPIView: it will give the list of everything 
	RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView: and if you want to access particular <int:pk> the use RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
	
-------------------
MODEL VIEW SET	:
		More shot version, you will have everything like delet, post, put update
		just import it and inhertit viewsets.ModelViewSet and thst all then define the queryset and serializer_class
		finish 
--------------------------------------------
RELATIONS in DRF
	ForeignKey usage:
		in model we can create a foreign with relation to other class in model.py
		like we have created a class Platform and then other class Videos (now we want that while getting the Platform details we also get
		details and name about the Videos inside that platform which is actuallyin other class) to do that
		
		in video class we will create the object with foreignKey for platform in models.py
				video=models.foreignkey(Platform, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='watchlist')
			CASCADE doing is when the channel is deleted all the video inside cahnnel will be deleted
			related_name is the name which we will use in the area in serializers.py class which will tell where to show the nested data
			
		Now what this foreign Key did? it just created Many to One relationship Django relationship
	
	PRACTICE: is sy jyada smj aayega
		creating a new Class Review, and as i know, review will child and parent will be movie
		now how to create relation, simply via foreign key, so that when someone get the Movie data, Review will appear in sub folder , 
		related_name:now sub_folder must have name it will be look b related_name field in foreign key,
		on_delete=models.CASCADE: it will do when the movie deleted so there is no meaning of review , so             all review	will be deleted
		
		Same way we will add the foreign Key in review class which we have created and will related with Videos
		
		NOW above this is only use to create the relation, now we also want to show the data and how it will work via below Nested 
		Serializer
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	NESTED SERIALIZERS: read above DRF as well for foreigion term usage and understanding
			everything in serializer.py remain same while creating the class,
			main differense is:
				when you create a relation Model what you did is created foreign class inside the Class which need to relate , like video need to relate with platform so foreignKey created in Videos and related with Platform
				
				in same way we have created review class and it need to relate with Videos and we created the foreign key in review class and relate with Video
				
				now difference here will be we write the additional line "related_name variable" in related class not in the smae class, like Video serializer remain same, and the variable will be defined in Platform serializer
				
			one serializer class is created, Video Serializer is already created and one more now created second one here PlatformSerializer we will add the variable here in Platform (because Platform k sath relation bnaya h humne, foreignkey was created in Videos Model .... bla bla u know)
			in above we have added related_name , define same name as class variable
				watchlist=VideoSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)
				class Meta:
					model=Platform
					fields=__all__
					
			REMEMBER: watchlist variable is same name as defined in foreigionkey in model related_name
			
			EXPLANATION: Whats the Idea it is Once we have created relation between two classes, each class show its own data, but we want that the Platform shows all its videos in list when we get all platforms
			
			before when we get all Platforms we see only platform details but now we will see Videos on that platform as well
			
	NOTE: it will eturn all the field in the model call, if we need specifi field we will use below Serializer Relation
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Serializer Relation:
		better to check with Guide, for serializer relation
			all need to change the name like PrimaryKey, StringRelated Field etc you will find in DRF site
	----------------------------------------------------
	HYPER LINKED SERIALIZERS
		concept to generate the ID as the link, or any field as link, 
		 to get the ID as link, just use the HyperLinkedModelSerializer as parent instead of ModelSerializer
		 adn where you are converting to model data to serilizer  in view line add extra after many=True
		 context={request=request} something like this not sure just check in the Document site of DRF
	 
	PURE PRACTICE for RELATION:
		so now in my inventory need to create the relation , steps need to be done:
			1: Create a Model class and define the fields,and then define the ForeignKey field,
				requirement=models.Foreigionkey(Class name, on_delete=CASCADE, related_name="")
			2: done now need to create the relation serializer, here the catch is relation ship will no define in the new class created 
				in serializer, We will define the relation in the class related to it, 
					Example: B is related to A, so we will create the new class B and define that B class inside ADD
			3:  create the class in serialzer and do basics Class Meta: etc (class must be created in top of the related class)
			4:  go to the class A and define the class B
				 while defining the field name it must be same as the related name in the Model,
					orders=A(many=True, read_only=True)
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE DOWN THE USER NAME WHO ADD DETAILS: (but this works only for the admin view addition

	1. Import User in models.py
			from django.contrib.auth.models import User
	2.now make a new field as foreignKey and add the User model as foreignKey
			userName= models.Foreigionkey(User,on_delete=CASCADE)
	3.now store the same field in the serilizer.py class same Review serializer
			userName= serializer.StringRelatedField(read_only=True)
	4. and in view.py must define the class with generic.CreateAPIView as parent
		assign serializer_class= class name of serializer
	5. def fucntion with self and serializer as argument
	6. define variable pk and the the data from the pk 	
			self.kwarg.get('pk')
	7. get the data from model object and stored in variable
			video= VideoModel.objects.get(pk=pk)
	8.and save the serializer and as argument pass the modeldata foreignkey of the class and the user name 
			serializer.save(forVideo=video,) (forVideo is the define in model.py and video is variable define in this function to get the 
													primary key data)
	9. and run		
------------------------------------------------------
CHECKING IF THE DETAILS IS FILLED BY ALREADY VIA ONE USER HE MUST NOT ABLE TO DO IT AGAIN (needs to be improved)
	
	inside the views.py same where we have define the above , simply ass the below steps before saving the serializer
	1. in views.py get the user name:
			user=self.request.user
	2. get the queryset , normal make the filter if the user has the same data
			query=Review.objects.filter(forVideo=video, userName=getUser ) (forVideo and userNAme is the variable define in the models.py)
	3. now you have filter out the data, like above will check if the filter returns something or blank
	4. now check via if confirtion using exists()
			if query.exists():
				raise ValidationError("Its alreday Exist") import the ValidationError from rest_framework.exception
	5. save the serializer and as argument pass the modeldata foreignkey of the class and in addition username as well
			serializer.save(forVideo=video, review_user=user)
	5. thats all now try to run and check 
	

-------------------------------
PERMISSIONS:
	first we will add the REST_FRAMEWORK in settings.py just to tell we have the permissions enabled and going to use
			REST_FRAMEWORK = {
				'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
					'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
				]
			}
	now the thing is IsAuthenticated is one example  there are many other like
	AlowAny, IsAdminUSer , IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly etc
	
	so gonna use all, because in exam i gota ask question only on this thing, and i fucking ruined it
	
	so when you add the above program in the settings so every thing will be locked and ask you to login
	in admin and then the access will work, else you will get error
	
Doing Views code for permissions
	so what need to set the particular view class permissions?, all we need is to add the below line:
				permission_classes=[IsAuthenticated]
			this example for the Class based Views, and 
			for functions based views we will use permissions decorator in top of function:
				@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
	remmember we will remove the permissions from settings.py as this settings will act global,
	if you need global then ok, else remove it
------------------------------------
CUSTOM PERMISSIONS:
	main thing, here we are going to create our own permissions, actually classes
	like i will create a class and apply the rule,
	
	let me ask you do you know how these permissions are actually working in views?
	Answer is permission_classes check the permission if they return true then res. further code is executed
	else it is throw the exception, so same way we will set the permission
	
	while setting the custom permission we will always return bool, so that we can check if they have the particular access or not
	
	
	now code time:
			so we will create a file name permissions.py in application
				here we will import thr permissions from rest_frmaework
				now create class with parameter permission type, example permissions.IsAdminUSer or
				permissions.Basepermissions etc
				
				you select anyone as per requirements
				
				Lets create two type of Authentication, one if its Admin then can edit else view
				and other if the login user is review user then can edit else view(like raghav cant edit chirag, but can edit Raghav)
				
				for admin only
					i will create class and inherit with IsAdminUSer class
						class AdminOrReadOnly(permissions.IsAdminUser):
					now define function, has_permissions(self, request, view)
						def has_permissions(self, request,view):
					below wiil be the body of function, 
							if request.method permissions .SAFE_METHODS:
								return True
							else:
								return bool(request.user and request.user.is_staf)
					explanin, here i am checking if the method is GET, somone trying to get the info then go get it
					hence returning true
					If someone want to update it? run else, and check if he is admin, only admin can make changes
					
				Now creating other permission is the persion try to update is reviewer it self, or creator
				for the in the information we already has set the reviewer name so that we can verify with login person
				like the information login person has get is the same person updating the information not the differnet one, raghav chirag vala case like above mentioned
				
				so here the code goes, thing will remain same, 
				creating class	with BasePermission parameters as we are checking the reviewer not the admin
						class ReviewerOrReadOnly(permissions.BasePermission):
							def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
								if request.methodnin permissions.SAFE_MODE
									return True
								else:
									return(obj.reviewer==request.user)
				
				Explanation: here we need the data from object to check detaisl so taking the object function
				returning yes if its GET method, else checking the obj.reviewer name is same as request.user which means is it same as the login person
				obj.reviewer returing name insisde the Model information stored in server
				adn request.user is returning the loginid name of the current user login
				if both are same then he can update is data else he cant
		NOTE: has_object_permission will only be called if using generic API, then default call will occure else you have to call exciplitly via check_object_permission(self, object) (and i dont know how to do it ) so we will go with GENERIC API
--------------------------------------		
GENERIC VIEWS:
	REASON for learning this Generic API: is below in permission cases has_object_permissions will only by default called if you have created Generic API, in normal API you have to call it explicitly and i dont know how to do that
	
	
-------------------------------
TEMPERORY   IN DRF
	No special thing all we need to do is add path in the project url with link api-auth and include restframework.urls
		path('api-auth',include('rest_framework.urls')
				
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOKEN AUTHENTICATION aading in application
	so token in DRF is one time token, once created it is created,
	going to working directly 
		in settings.py we will add
				'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication'
			it will be added inside the REST_FRAMEWORK{} dectionary key as 'DEFAULT_AUTHENTIACTION_CLASSES': and value is ist [] obove one
			
--	And also need to add the 'rest_framework.authtoken' in INSTALLED_APPS, 
	and then we will migrate t so that new installed app can be worked and synced with DRF and show the Token field in admin panel

--	URLS part
		add the path
			path['login/',obtain_auth_token]
		we have to import it from the reset_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token
	
--	GENERATING TOKEN AFTER ADDING USER
	Ok all done now open the Admin login in django rest you will see the Token name , add the token for users via clicking add token adn token will be genrated for the selected user
	
	OR
	
	to get token from Postman, open the postman, go to the Body and Form data and enter the
	this will be the POST for login url end point
		Key                      Value
		username				Raghav
		password                Raghav@22
	
	remember username and password is the default field in the User Model , 
	
	NOW CHECKING WITH POSTMAN:(not worked)
		Open the postman, and then in the URL link enter your Local link
		once done now time to check the authentication:
			as you have put the Authentication, so data will not be work as we need login authentication and how do we check in postman?
				Simply open Header tab,
					in Key enter the key as Authorization
					and value will be Token hscnijodnnkjcb (its token ID)		
				and boom it will work now
	
	JUST for basic authentiacation:
		key: Authentication
		Value: Basic username:password in base64 encoded
		
-- GETTING TOKEN FROM POSTMAN RATHER THEN FROM THE DRF ADMIN LOGIN:
	one is setting the path in urls.py
	second step is calling the token from postman
		in the Python URL you need to import the obtain_auth_token from rest_framework.authtoken.views
			and then set the path
				path('login/',obtain_auth_token,name='login')
				
	all done with the url part 
	
	--now open the POSTMAN
	go to Body tab, enter the key username bydefault django took username not email
		Key: username and Value is: name of user  user
		Key: password and Value password of the  user
	both Key need to be enter and then change to Post enter the URl link set in path and boom post
	all done you will get the token in your POSTMAN

-------------------------------------------------	
CREATING NEW USER in User Model , (this model is by defalut provided by the DRF where all user data is stored super user wala)

	Learning in this Segment
		Here we will learn registering the user/creating new user, 
		checking password twice if he enter password and confirm password is same
		Checking if the user he entere the email already stored by someone
	And all this be done in serializer.py file 
		Additionaly:
			We will create the new field in serializer which is not stored in the Model
			Adding the style for the field which is already created in teh Model but we havenot defined or mentioned while creating fiel
	
--	Lets Start:
		Structure of this app is:
			models>serializer>views>urls
		
-- Strating From MODEL
		we dont need to create the model as we are going to use default model Users
		
--	Serializer Time:	
	in serializer import User Model 
			from django.contrib.auth.models import User
	
	now our main task is to check the password and confirm password so we will create a variable in the serializer class password2
		password2= serializer.CharField(style={'input_type':'password'},write_only=True)
		now define the Class Meta: withe model and field variable , this time introducing new concept how to add field desing in already
			created field in model, for that we will user extra_kwargs variable inside class meta, it hold the all fields created in Model
					extra_kwargs={
						'password':{'write_only':True}
					}
			its dectionary hold all the fields defined in the Models.py
	
		we have to save the serializer in views.py (obviously) so it is going to run the save method, when it runs 
		the save method and it will check and run Object.create method becuase we have create the new field
		password2 and with write_only as true so we need to define it and maintain it, 
		
		we will override the save method and we are doing so we will do other validation check in same part
		**save Method is override outside the Class Meta scope
		1.Password and password2 checking 
		2.Email user going to add must not be added for another user
			
			def save(self):
				#get the password which is getting post using validated_data
				password= self.validated_data['password']
				#get password two
				password2= self.validated_data['password2']
				#now check both are same
				if password != password2:
					#raise the ValidatioError dictionary
					raise serializer.ValidatioError({'error':'p1 and p2 must be same'})
					
				#now checking if the mail enter is not exist, not used by any other user
				#it will get from the Model User as we are getting already stored data and filter it
				email=User.objects.filter(email=self.validated_data['email'])
				#now check if it exists
					if email.exists():
						raise serializer.validationError({'email':'Email already exists'})
				
				#now all validation is checked it's time to save those details the main purpose was to save the 
				details
				#now we have to save the data in database of user, so we will get the User details and then save
				the password set_password function
				account=User(email=self.validate_data['email'], username=self.validate_data['username']
				account.set_password(password)
				account.save()
				
				return account()
				
				
		
--	Now Coming to Views.py so we need to add the user so we will use the POST, this time lets impliment the POST function
	and we need decorators api_view , we will get the decorators from rest_framework.deciorators import api_views
	
		@api_view(['POST',])
		def resgitrationView(request)
			if request.method=="POST":
				serializer=RegistrationSerializer(data=request.data)
				if serializer.is_valid():
					serializer.save()
					return Response(serializer.data())
					
--	Coming to urls.py
		so we need to generate the token as well for that we will use obtain_auth_token and it will be imported 
			from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token
		Import the View which we have created above
			and enter it in 
				urlpatterns=[
					path('register/',view_name)
				]
			
		
--	Coming to POSTMAN
		So we are going to add the user details in the fields declared in the Serializer
			so we will add the link of the uRL and 
			then do to Body and form-data
				in Key enter the fields name ione by one and th value enter the value which need to be added	
---------------------------------------------	
TOKEN CREATION POST SAVING:
	in previous we are creating the user and then we are creating token separately
	now we are going to both things at single go
	
	what we need? first a model to store the token data
	and then in views part we will define a dictionary as it need to be passed
	
--  in models.py
		we will simply copy paste it from the documenttaion for Authnetication TOKEN
			from django.conf import settings
			from django.db.models.signals import post_save
			from django.dispatch import receiver
			from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token

			@receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
			def create_auth_token(sender, instance=None, created=False, **kwargs):
				if created:
					Token.objects.create(user=instance)
					
--	in views.py
		import the model package directly, reason we have made the function there not the 
		import your serializer
		from rest_framework.authtoken.model import Token
		
		@api_view(['POST'])
		def register_view(request):
		
			if request.method=='POST':
				serializer= RegisterSerializer(data=request.data)
				#create new dictionary where we will add name password , so that we can get the token
				data={}
				if serializer.is_valid():
					account=serializer.save() #returning save data,cz we have overided the save in serailiser and returning validated data
					#creating the token with below line:
					token=Token.object.get_or_create(user=account).key
					#adding the dictionary data just to get the details what we have created 
					data['response']='Registration Successful'
					data['username']=account.username
					data['email']=account.email
					data['token']=token
				else:
					data=serializer.error
				
			return Response(data)

--	urls m save kro apna view link nad then carry on with postman
		same link for Post, and in Body , form data enter the key and values, 
		key will be all the fields in serializer and value that user values
		
		Key				Value
		username		Raghav
		email			raghav@gmail.com
		pasword			Raghav@22
		password2		Raghav@22
	
*So now register user got logedin directly and , after registration no need to login again for token creation, once login 
	obtain_aut_token will work				
------------------------------------
TOKEN DELETION				
	simpliy, we will create the function in views.py
	
	@api_view(['POST'])
	def logout_view(request):
		if request.method=='POST':
			request.user.auth_token.delete()
			return Response(status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
	
--	add the url in urls.python

--	Postman
		add the Link for Post same as urls.py
		and then header , 
		key will be Authorization and value is Token msdbcjkdfhuksdb (token code of user)
		
		
		
NOTE: for the Login field, we will use the Body in postman
		sand for the deletion of token we will use Header with token
--------------------------
JWT AUTH TOKEN:
	install the simpletjwt token, 
	read documentation from the site rest-framework-simpletjwt-token
	
	enter settings.py part (inside the REST_FRAMEWORK in DEFAULT_AUTHENTIACTION_CLASSES there we will mention)
	
	enter urls.py part: here we will add the rest_framework_simplejwt import TokenObtainPairView, TokenRefreshView
	and then add there path :
			path('api/token/',TokenObtainPairView.as_view()),
			path('api/token/refresh',TokenRefreshView.ad_view())
			
	now  path('api/token/',TokenObtainPairView.as_view()), this URL is used to generate the token both refresh 
		and the access, and for that we will use POSTMAN cant dirctly generate or use the Browser
		and for this token generation, we will enter the details in:
				Body,
					Key           value 
					username      Raghav
					password      Raghav@22
		
		thats done, it will create the token for the user Raghav
	now how to use it, we will open anothe postman tab in Post and then go to Header and use the Bearer for token
				Header,
					Key                value 
					Authorization      Bearer dbvfdvjahfhbahsbvyvb34qt74gyfg784
					
	now how to use refresh token to get the access token again for that we will use:
		path('api/token/refresh',TokenRefreshView.ad_view()) this url
		open the new tab for POSTMAN and there enter the vaue in Body tab
					Body,
					Key           value 
					refresh      refresh_wala_token
		and boom you will get the new access token actually same one
		
	now we want rather then manual constructicting access token again and again we will construct automatically
		via using 'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN
	so whenever JWT token is created it is created two token one is 
	Refresh Token: stays for 24 hours and user to develop the access token
	Access Token:  It expired in 5 minutes, but refresh token can generate the new one, for that we need to keep it true
					in settings.py using below code
							
							SIMPLE_JWT={
								'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN'=True,
							}
							
--	Getting Token from JWT, 
		in old version we was using the Token model to get the token
		via:
			token=Token.objects.get_or_create(user=account) #account hold the serailiser.save() information
		which mainly returns username password so we need to define/overload the def save(self) in serializer
		
		Basically we need the the details to get the token, mainly username or password, 
		so above account contains the userName
		
		in jwt we will use documentataion, 
				refresh=RefreshToken.for_user(account)
				
		it generated the token before that import it from rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens import RefreshToken
		
		now need to add the token in the data['token']
		you know data is just the variable we have created in the class as dictionary variable which will help
		in storing the data and reqturn the same dictionary data
		
		data[token]={
			'refresh': str(refresh),
			'access': str(refresh.access_token),
		}
		
		here we are returing the dictionary to dictionary

By default access Token Time is 5 minutes, and the refresh token time is 10 minutes,
so you can also change it , all you need is to follow the steps in the JWT authentiacation documentation and it 
will work,just study and give a go
------------------------
THROTTLING:
	This concept is same as the Permission, the difference is that it will restrtict the API count , like the request coming to the API from user end must nbe in limit
	
	need to add in the settings REST_FRAMEWORK
	
		REST_FRAMEWORK = {
			'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
				'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
				'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle'
			],
			'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
				'anon': '100/day',
				'user': '1000/day'
			}
		}
		
AnnoRateThrottle is for the Anonymous user , not registered in our site
and 
UserRateThrottle is for the registered user

-- View based throttling, 
		as the above statement is used for the complete throttling, for user based throtking we will removet the 
		DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES and then add the below

in the view we will use the same procedure for the permission_classes same 
	import rest_framework.throttling  import UserRateThrottle, AnnoRateThrottle
		throttle_classes= [UserRateThrottle]
		
we can change the request count for hours , minutes , seconds etc

----------------------
